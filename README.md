# Computational Analysis of Character Development in Holocaust Testimonies
By Esther Shizgal, Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar and Omri Abend

### Abstract

This work analyzes character development by capturing both their religious behaviors and their expressed belief systems. We propose a computational analysis of the interplay of internal and external changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative. Our framework employs a two-dimensional analysis, one dimension captures the protagonist’s world of beliefs, and the other describes the practices that may express their inner life. As a test case, we view Holocaust testimony transcripts, each telling the story of an individual. We focus on exploring the protagonist’s religious trajectory, examining the evolution of religious beliefs and practices throughout the narrative. The trajectories are extracted by prompting and fine-tuning LLMs.

We cluster the resulting trajectories in the dataset, identifying common sequences in the data. 
Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religious activity across the narratives; most present a constant disposition toward religion, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research.
